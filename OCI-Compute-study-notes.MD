## Burstable Instance

> :grey_question: What is Burstable Instance

  A burstable instance is a `virtual machine instance` that provides a `baseline level of CPU performance` with the ability to `burst to a higher level to support occasional spikes in usage`. Burstable instances are designed for scenarios where an instance is typically idle or has low CPU utilization with occasional spikes in usage.

> :grey_question: Why Burstable Instance

  It is cheaper than regular Instance, Burstable Instance provides a ``base line of 12.5% or 50% CPU performance``, Burst is contingent on available capactity, if a physical host is over subscriped, no boost will take place. . However the ``cost is charged based on baseline`` settings.

## Vertical Scalling

> :grey_question: What is Vertical Scaling?
  
    Vertical Scaling is taking existing instance and change its shape to bigger capacity, e.g the CPU count and Memory Size.
