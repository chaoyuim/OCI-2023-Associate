## Burstable Instance

> What is Burstable Instance

  A burstable instance is a `virtual machine instance` that provides a `baseline level of CPU performance` with the ability to `burst to a higher level to support occasional spikes in usage`. Burstable instances are designed for scenarios where an instance is typically idle or has low CPU utilization with occasional spikes in usage.

> Why Burstable Instance

  It is cheaper than regular Instance, Burstable Instance provides a ``base line of 12.5% or 50% CPU performance``, when needed, it will burst / boost to 100%. However the ``cost is charged based on baseline`` settings.
